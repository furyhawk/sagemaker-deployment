In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

    "### Uploading Training / Validation files to S3\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For this, and most other tasks we will be doing using SageMaker, there are two methods we could use. The first is to use the low level functionality of SageMaker which requires knowing each of the objects involved in the SageMaker environment. The second is to use the high level functionality in which certain choices have been made on the user's behalf. The low level approach benefits from allowing the user a great deal of flexibility while the high level approach makes development much quicker. For our purposes we will opt to use the high level approach although using the low-level approach is certainly an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the method `upload_data()` which is a member of object representing our current SageMaker session. What this method does is upload the data to the default bucket (which is created if it does not exist) into the path described by the key_prefix variable. To see this for yourself, once you have uploaded the data files, go to the S3 console and look to see where the files have been uploaded.\n",

As you continue to complete and execute notebooks you will eventually fill up this disk space, leading to errors which can be difficult to diagnose. Once you are completely finished using a notebook it is a good idea to remove the files that you created along the way. Of course, you can do this from the terminal or from the notebook hub if you would like. The cell below contains some commands to clean up the created files from within the notebook."
